- 👋 Hi, I’m Winicjusz. From June 2021, I had to take a break in coding for health reasons and then deal with our investments in connection with the outbreak of war in Ukraine. Now I am going back to my hobby coding and I hope nothing will disturb me :-). The following codes are not my codes, but training codes that I have worked on myself and now I know them very well and understand exactly how they work. Inside the codes sometimes are my comments showing how I understand these codes. One of my independent code is my personal website called "PrivateWebSide2", which, based on the knowledge gained by studying the above-mentioned training codes - I designed myself,  I coded myself and then I hosted myself - from May 2021. until October 2021 - via the "nazwa.pl" company at the address (currently closed) www.winicjusz.pl., but now you can see it at:  https://winicjusz1.github.io/PivateWebSide2 
- 👀 I’m interested in languages/tools and frameworks: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Bootstrap, Sass preprocessor, BEM syntax. I am using the IDE in the form of the Visual Studio Code editor.
- 🌱 I’m currently focus my learning JavaScrip, PHP.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in order to develop javascript & PHP skills.
- 📫 How to reach me: just write to me e-mail, using address: winicjuszcyboran@gmail.com
