- 👋 Hi, I’m Winicjusz. From June 2021, I had to take a break in coding for health reasons and then deal with our investments in connection with the outbreak of war in Ukraine. Now I am going back to my hobby coding and I hope nothing will disturb me :-)
- 👀 I’m interested in languages/tools and frameworks: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Sass preprocessor, BEM syntax. I am using the IDE in the form of the Visual Studio Code editor.
- 🌱 I’m currently focus my learning JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in order to develop javascrypt skills.
- 📫 How to reach me: just write to me e-mail, using address: winicjuszcyboran@gmail.com
