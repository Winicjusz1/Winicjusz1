- 👋 Hi, I’m Winicjusz. From June 2021, I had to take a break in coding for health reasons and then deal with our investments in connection with the outbreak of war in Ukraine. Now I am going back to my hobby coding and I hope nothing will disturb me :-). The following codes are not my codes, but training codes that I have worked on myself and now I know them very well and understand exactly how they work. Inside the codes sometimes are my comments. One of my independent code is my personal website called "PrivateWebSide2", which, based on the knowledge gained by studying the above-mentioned training codes - I designed myself,  I coded myself and then I hosted myself - from May 2021. until October 2021 - via the "nazwa.pl" company at the address (currently closed) www.winicjusz.pl., but now you can see it at:  https://winicjusz1.github.io/PivateWebSide2 
- 👀 I’m interested in languages/tools and frameworks: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Sass preprocessor, BEM syntax. I am using the IDE in the form of the Visual Studio Code editor.
- 🌱 I’m currently focus my learning JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in order to develop javascript skills.
- 📫 How to reach me: just write to me e-mail, using address: winicjuszcyboran@gmail.com
